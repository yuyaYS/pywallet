In this code, each block is consited of four components.
1. timestamp, 2. transactions, 3. nonce, 4, previous_hash.

---How to find nonce---.
Nonce = chanllege_1 + previous hash + transcation
challenge_1 is the potentail number for nonce.

Assming after you calculate Nonce for the first time, it was 23vf3ninidnvn32ini.
We will continue to do more chanllege untill the first four digit is 0000(depending on dificulity, you can setup more long digit like 0000.....00000).

In chanllege 50, the nounce was 0000bn4fnnjnn3nbfenfkefkn. GOOD, now we have nouce which is 50.
